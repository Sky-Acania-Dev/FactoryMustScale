# FactoryMustScale
FactoryMustScale is a Unity 2D factory-simulation prototype focused on deterministic simulation, data-oriented design, and performance at scale.  This project explores how far a classic MonoBehaviour architecture, reinforced with explicit data layers and fixed-step simulation, can be pushed before DOTS/ECS becomes truly necessary.
